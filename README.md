## Project 1 - S&P 500 Companies Analysis
### About
Completed python project ‘S&P 500 Companies Analysis’ as part of my advanced python course ‘Data Science Programming’ curriculum. The objective of this project is as follows:
* Utilize advanced python tools and libraries (NumPy, pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib) to analyze S&P 500 Companies data.
  * Data download, cleaning, and preparation.
  * Update missing data elements through user input.
* Generate various analytical reports to show:
  * Companies by Sector
  * Top Ten (10) Dividend Yield Companies by Sector
  * Top Five (5) Companies with the lowest 52 Week Price Change along with corresponding P/E Ratio.
* Generate data visualization charts for the above reports.

Generated reports and charts for analysis as shown below:
* Analyzed each sector about financial strength/Market Cap, along with overall financial performance/EBITDA. Generated Pie Chart to show companies within each sector.
* Analyzed the top ten dividend yield companies along with the P/E ratio within each sector in order to get the best returns on investment. Sector wise group charts provide clear visuals to pick the best dividend yield companies.
* Analyzed the top five most stable companies within each sector along with corresponding P/E ratio. Sector wise group charts provide clear visuals to pick the right companies for investment.

## Project 2 - Daily Activity Fitness Tracker
### About
The objective of this project is as follows:
* Utilize advanced python tools and libraries (Numpy, Panda, Matplotlib, Scipy) to analyze Activity data.
  * Data download, cleaning, and preparation.
  * Join multiple dataset tables
  * Add new columns to merged dataset
  * Run statistical analysis tests
* Generate various analytical reports to show: 
  * List Daily Summary data
  * List average Calories, Step Total, Activity Minutes, and Activity Distance by Id
  * Display Statistics of the Total criteria columns in Activity dataset
  * List the Correlation between Step Total and Calories by Id
  * Perform Linear Regression to analyze if Calories is impacted by Total Active Distance and Total Active Minutes
  * Run a t-test to see if the mean of Step Total is equal to the recommended step total 10,000
* Generate data visualization charts for the above reports. 

Generated reports and charts for analysis as shown below:
* Reported Daily Summary data making it easier to view at a glance the necessary data for the individuals daily report, all related to the days activity total.
* Reported and analyzed individuals overall average activity intensity breakdown.
* Reported the overall statistics of the individuals daily total data. This allowed me to see who was the most active, who was the least active, what their max/min calorie expenditure was and overall average.
* Reported the correlation values for each individual, showing who had the highest correlation between total steps and calories. Displayed graph charts and line charts to analyze visually the individual’s with the highest/lowest correlation between total steps and calories.
* Performed Linear Regression to analyze if Calories is impacted by Total Active Distance and Total Active Minutes.
* Performed statistical testing, One sample t-test, on if the mean of Step Total is equal to the recommended step total 10,000.
